    <h1>MY PROFILE</h1>
    <h3>Hi there,</h3>
    <h4>It's nice to meet you.</h4>

    <p>I'm currently a student at Makerere University studying a Bachelors of Software engineering. I am currently
        in my first year second semester.</p>
    <p>I was born and raised in Uganda where i developed a strong interest in the way technology affects behaviour
        in a society. I'm easily inspired by unique places and my own experience.</p>
